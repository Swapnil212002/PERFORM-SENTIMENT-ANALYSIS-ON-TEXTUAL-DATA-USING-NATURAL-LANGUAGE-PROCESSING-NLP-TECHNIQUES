## DESCRIPTION

This project focuses on performing sentiment analysis on textual data such as tweets or reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is a key application of NLP used to determine whether a piece of text expresses a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. This technique is widely used in industries such as marketing, customer service, and finance to gauge customer opinions, product feedback, and public perception.

The dataset used for this project is a small sample of tweets, each labeled with a sentiment class—positive, negative, or neutral. The data serves as a representation of real-world textual input from social media or review platforms. The goal is to preprocess this data, extract meaningful features, train a machine learning model, and evaluate its performance in predicting sentiments.

The project begins with data preprocessing, a crucial step in NLP. Textual data is inherently noisy and unstructured, requiring cleaning before analysis. This involves converting text to lowercase, removing URLs, special characters, and punctuation, as well as stemming words to their root form. Common stopwords (like "is", "the", and "and") are also removed to reduce noise and improve the relevance of the features.

Once the text is cleaned, we use the TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency) technique to convert text into numerical vectors. TF-IDF captures the importance of a word in a document relative to its frequency across the entire dataset, making it a powerful method for representing text in a machine-readable format.

Next, the dataset is split into training and testing sets. A Logistic Regression model is employed for classification. Logistic Regression is a simple yet effective algorithm for binary and multi-class classification problems, especially when interpretability and speed are important.

The model is trained on the training set and then evaluated on the test set using metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report (precision, recall, F1-score). These metrics provide insight into how well the model distinguishes between sentiment classes and where it may struggle, particularly with neutral or ambiguous content.

The results show promising performance for such a lightweight model and small dataset. The confusion matrix visualization highlights areas where the model misclassifies sentiments, providing opportunities for future improvements.

Finally, the project outlines potential enhancements such as using larger, real-world datasets (e.g., from Twitter API, IMDb, or Amazon reviews), exploring deep learning methods (like LSTM or BERT), and incorporating word embeddings (Word2Vec or GloVe) for improved context understanding.

In summary, this project provides a complete pipeline for building a sentiment analysis tool using NLP. It covers all critical stages—from data preprocessing and feature extraction to model training and evaluation—demonstrating how machine learning can be applied to understand human emotions in text. This project not only serves as a foundational exercise in NLP and text classification but also opens the door to more advanced applications in customer experience management, brand monitoring, and automated feedback analysis.
